You might be wondering, did I write all of this code myself? The answer is a mix of yes and no. Throughout my programming career, it has been a common practice to seek out references. Back in 2001, we relied on comprehensive resources like the PHP, JavaScript, HTML "bibles," which were enormous books updated annually.

As the internet era progressed, developers transitioned from scouring forums to websites, then to search engines like Google, StackOverflow, and now platforms like ChatGPT. The landscape of software development continues to evolve, with new paths and tools constantly emerging.
